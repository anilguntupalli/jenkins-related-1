Now we are going to start jenkins slave setup .
Requirements:
1.Jenkins master
2.slave machine : any Linux OS ec2 instance.

Now i am going to create slave ec2 machine
Now we are at slave machine.
1. creating normal user and admin permissions. 
2. Giving password based authentication enabling,(by default it is disabled).

Note: before Jenkins 1.x versions a JLNP agent is automatically install and it will automatically install java and maven.But now it is not working, Like Jenkins master " now we have to manually installing java, maven and also set environment variables in slave machine,, also set environment variables.

apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk -y    :--> to install java , it is open JDK 8 version is install otherwise to our qt blog install oracle java that is not a problem
which java     ---> to know java install or not:" it will give /usr/bin/java
readlink -f /usr/bin/java    -->/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/   " we use this to set environment variable"
cd /opt    ïƒ  From this we are going to install maven
sudo wget http://redrockdigimark.com/apachemirror/maven/maven-3/3.5.4/binaries/apache-maven-3.5.4-bin.tar.gz
tar xzf apache-maven-3.5.4-bin.tar.gz
sudo ln -s /opt/apache-maven-3.5.4/bin/mvn /usr/bin/mvn

Setting environment variables

Note: we are doing all this in slave machine.
		
sudo vi /etc/profile
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:$JAVA_HOME/bin
M2_HOME=/opt/apache-maven-3.5.4
PATH=$PATH:$M2_HOME/bin
export M2_HOME
export PATH

till now configurations in slave machine is over.
Now we are going to jenkins master

slave machine is ready.
See video and understand how to run project on slave machine
